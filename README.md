# 🚀 Al4k1xkali - Your One-Stop Pen Testing Playground 🛡️

Welcome to Al4k1xkali! This wicked Docker-Compose-based pen-testing lab is locked and loaded with the following:

- **Kali**: This ain't just any Docker container, it's armed with Kali Linux, the Swiss Army knife of pen testing. It's got your back!
- **Target**: An intentionally vulnerable Docker container that serves as your testing target. It's begging to be hacked!
- **DVWA**: The notorious Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), a PHP/MySQL web server with intentional vulnerabilities. It's a hacker's playground! 

## 💻 Prerequisites

You need to be geared up with:

- Docker
- Docker-Compose

## 🚀 Getting Started

To fire up the Al4k1xkali lab, all you gotta do is cruise to the project directory and run the `start.sh` script like a boss:

```bash
./start.sh
```

or 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## ⚠️ Caution

This lab is bursting with security vulnerabilities, so handle with care! It's meant for a safe, isolated environment and NOT for a production setup or a network housing sensitive data. Play safe!
